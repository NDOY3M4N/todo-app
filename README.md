- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Vue Draggable Next](https://vue-draggable-next.vercel.app/) - Vue 3 drag-and-drop component based on Sortable.js
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A nice CSS Framework

### Useful resources

- [Theming Tailwind with CSS Variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAtaT8BZEAo) - This video from **Tailwind Labs** helped me for implementing the dark/light theme.
- [Styling Form Elements with Tailwind CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pONeWAzDsQg) - This video (also from Tailwind Labs) explains how to style a form element (in my case the checkbox input) using `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin.
